- Proper spacing for air circulation
- Choose disease-resistant varieties

**üßπ Sanitation:**
- Clean tools between plants
- Remove plant debris promptly
- Rotate crops annually

**üìä Record Keeping:**

**üìä Cost-Benefit Analysis:**
- Calculate potential crop loss value
- Compare treatment costs vs. expected yield protection
- Consider labor time in total cost

**üéØ Priority Investments:**
1. Disease monitoring system (like this AI tool)
2. Quality preventive sprays
3. Resistant seed varieties
4. Proper irrigation system

**üí° Money-Saving Tips:**
- Buy fungicides in bulk when on sale
- Use integrated pest management (IPM)
- Share equipment with neighboring farms
- Apply treatments at optimal times (avoid waste)

- Don't spray during bloom (protect pollinators)
- Allow proper re-entry time after chemical applications
