## Historical Trend Analysis
- **Disease Patterns Over Time:** Insufficient data available to establish reliable trends.
- **Comparison with Previous Sessions:** Data quality assessment is currently building a baseline.
- **Seasonal Insights:** Based on existing patterns, there were higher instances of apple scab detected, suggesting a need for seasonal monitoring.
- **Progression Indicators:** No clear indicators available until more data is gathered.

## Disease Distribution Analysis
- **Most Prevalent Diseases:**
  - Apple Scab: 4 detections across 4 images.
  - Grape Healthy: 1 detection.
- **Images with Multiple Disease Types:** No images with multiple diseases detected.
- **Confidence Level Patterns:** Apple scab detections showed high confidence levels, indicating strong confirmation of presence.

## Key Findings and Recommendations
- **Most Affected Plants/Areas:** Apple trees exhibiting symptoms of apple scab require urgent attention.
- **Severity Assessment Based on Detection Density:** Areas with recurrent apple scab detections should be prioritized.
- **Suggested Actions or Treatments:**
  - Immediate fungicidal treatment for apple scab.
  - Regular monitoring for grape health to secure the integrity of the crop.
- **Priority Areas Needing Attention:** Focus on apple trees with confirmed apple scab.
- **Preventive Measures Based on Trends:** Establish a regular monitoring schedule to track disease progression and prevent outbreaks.
