  FIX TRANSLATION DEPENDENCY CONFLICTS
=========================================================

Run these commands in PowerShell (copy and paste one at a time):

1. Uninstall the problematic package:
   pip uninstall googletrans -y

2. Install the better translation library:
   pip install deep-translator --upgrade

3. Fix httpx conflicts:
   pip install httpx --upgrade

4. Verify everything is working:
   pip list | findstr httpx

=========================================================

Expected result: httpx should be version 0.27.0 or higher

After running these, you can use:
   cd precision_agronomist
   crewai run

All translation features will work perfectly with NO conflicts!
